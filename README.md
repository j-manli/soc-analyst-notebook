# soc-analyst-notebook


This repo is a working notebook of my threat hunting and security investigation learning.
It contains a mix of completed investigations, raw analysis notes, detection ideas, and open questions captured during hands-on testing.
The main focus is me documenting how I think while analyzing attacker tradecraft … *mistakes and all*.
